## üß† Problem Statement

Despite recording strong total sales figures year-to-date, the company lacks clarity on **which vehicle types, customer preferences, regions, and brands** are truly driving success‚Äîand where resources may be underutilized. To optimize its sales strategy, the company needs to:
- Identify top-performing and underperforming segments.
- Understand monthly and weekly sales fluctuations.
- Analyze pricing trends and their relation to customer behavior.
- Align inventory, promotions, and partnerships with actual market demand.

This dashboard serves as a **decision-making tool** to turn raw car sales data into actionable business intelligence.

## üìä Dashboard Overview & Chart-by-Chart Analysis

### ‚úÖ **1. KPI Summary**
**Metrics:**
- **Total Cars Sold**: 23.91K  
- **YTD Average Price**: $28.09K  
- **Total Sales Value**: $671.53M  

These KPIs give a high-level overview of company performance. While impressive, the values lack context without comparisons to past performance or strategic targets. A breakdown by category, region, or product line is needed to uncover what is driving these figures.

---

### üìà **2. YTD Monthly Sales Trend**
**Insight:**
- **Lowest sales**: Month 1  
- **Highest sales**: Month 11  

Sales fluctuate across the year, with a clear end-of-year peak. The spike in Month 11 likely reflects seasonal promotions or demand cycles. The low in Month 1 may suggest weak market engagement or lack of new inventory.  
‚û°Ô∏è *Marketing and sales efforts should focus on replicating Month 11 strategies in underperforming periods.*

---

### üí∞ **3. YTD Average Price Trend**
**Insight:**
- **Lowest price**: Month 1  
- **Highest price**: Month 8  

The average price rose steadily through the year, peaking in Month 8. This suggests an increase in premium vehicle sales (e.g., SUVs) or the introduction of high-value inventory.  
‚û°Ô∏è *The company should replicate Month 8‚Äôs pricing strategy and align inventory releases to months that support high-value purchases.*

---

### üöò **4. Sales by Body Style**
**Insight:**
- **Top styles**: SUV ($99.9M), Passenger ($82.8M), Sedan ($73.7M)  
- **Least**: Hardtop ($51.4M)

SUVs lead in sales by a wide margin, followed by Passenger and Sedan vehicles. These styles contribute the most to revenue.  
‚û°Ô∏è *Inventory, marketing, and production should focus more on high-demand styles, particularly SUVs.*

---

### üé® **5. Sales by Car Colour**
**Insight:**
- **Top-selling colors**: Pale White ($174.5M), Black ($125.2M), Red ($71.4M)

Color preference strongly impacts customer choices. Pale White and Black dominate sales and should be prioritized in stock planning.  
‚û°Ô∏è *Limit production of low-performing colors and align visual branding with top color choices.*

---

### üè¢ **6. Company-wise Sales Analysis**
**Insight:**
- **Top brands**: Chevrolet ($27.1M), Ford ($25.4M), Dodge ($25M)  
- **Lagging brands**: Saturn, BMW (below $12M)

Brand-level sales vary significantly. Chevrolet and Ford perform consistently, while some premium brands underdeliver.  
‚û°Ô∏è *Build stronger retail and marketing partnerships with top brands and reassess efforts on lagging ones.*

---

### üåç **7. Region vs Transmission Type**
**Insight:**
Some regions favor **Manual** transmission despite the dominance of **Automatic** elsewhere.

‚û°Ô∏è *Regional demand should guide inventory allocation‚Äîmanual vehicles should be stocked more in regions where they are preferred.*

---

### üìÖ **8. Weekly Sales Trend**
**Insight:**
Sales trend upward steadily, peaking near year-end.

‚û°Ô∏è *The company should analyze the drivers behind peak weeks (e.g., promotions, events) and replicate them mid-year to balance sales distribution.*

---

## üìå Summary of Findings

- The company performs best in **SUV and Pale White car segments**.
- There is a clear **seasonal trend** in both volume and pricing.
- **Brand and regional behavior** are key variables that should inform future planning.
- **Manual transmission** demand in some regions is a valuable insight for localized inventory strategy.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Prioritize high-demand inventory**: Focus on SUVs and top-selling colors (Pale White, Black).
2. **Enhance seasonal marketing**: Replicate Month 11 promotions during lower-performing months.
3. **Strategic pricing**: Use Month 8 pricing trends to inform optimal vehicle rollout and upselling strategies.
4. **Segment regional inventory**: Offer manual vs auto transmission based on regional preference insights.
5. **Refine brand partnerships**: Boost collaboration with top performers like Chevrolet and Ford; re-evaluate low-contributors.
6. **Introduce benchmarks**: Add YoY comparison and sales targets to the dashboard for context and goal tracking.
7. **Use insights for forecasting**: Build predictive models based on weekly/monthly sales and pricing trends.
